# Seeking Sasquatch

##Summary

Deployed at: www.seeking-sasquatch.com

**Seeking Sasquatch** is a web app that displays an interactive map of recorded bigfoot sightings previously submitted to the BFRO (Bigfoot Field Research Organization). Each marker contains the date the sighting took place, and a link to a full description of the event as recorded by the eye witness. 

Those lucky enough to site the elusive Bigfoot can create an account to record the location, description, and an image they took documenting their own experience.
