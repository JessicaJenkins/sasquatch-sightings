"Ed L. was salmon fishing with a companion in Prince William Sound. After anchoring off shore, his companion took a small boat up a river to check on the state of the salmon run. As the day wore on toward evening and he didn't come back at the expected time, Ed scanned upriver and across the adjacent land with binoculars. There he saw a sasquatch walking across the tundra, with long, smooth steps and with dark hair flowing from its shoulders, bouncing behind ""like a cape"" at every step. The sasquatch paid no attention to the boat (distance about 1,000').",
"Hello, My name is Doug and though I am very reluctant to post this story; I am going to do so anyways. The area that this happened  could not be a more unlikely area for a bigfoot occurance then or  especially now with all the development of the farmland in the last 25 years which has been extensive and at a phenominal rate. After reading many (if not every last report on this website) and coming across more that a few that have happened in improbable areas (bigfoot running down neighborhood streets and sightings/ vocalizations near condo areas), I decided there just might be some merit in submitting this for review. A skilled researcher might be able to shed some more light maybe. My friends parents owned a small somewhat defunct farm with (I'm guessing maybe 15-20 acres of land -not the best judge on that) They had 3 horses; 2 mares that were allowed out in the field areas; a stabled stallion, and a pony I believe. The barn was in dis-repair and part of the roof had collapsed years earlier. There was a large pond that was almost completely enclosed with an impenatrable thicket of briars ringing almost the whole cirmcuference of the pond, except for a small area that was kept open for access for the horses to water. Much of the property was overgrown with these same briars that tended to make big circular mounds here and there in the field. The house sat close to the road; the barn to the left and further behind. The extreme left side of their property was bordered by a small stream that edged along a small (100 ft x 30 ft) stand of very dense pine trees. These pines (species unknown) tend to have a very dense understory of almost horizontal dead, dry, branches due to years of growth an minimal sunlight. The lower end of this pine grove had a mowed lawn area (next door neighbors property who were also related to my friend family) You had to access the camping area through the neighbors propery as the overgrowth of briars and other weeds, brambles, trees made it impossible to get there directly for the E------- property. The pond in relation to the campsite was to the left if you were looking back up towards the road; with the stream running between. The dense pine grove then lay between you and the road; unless you skirted around it through the neigbors backyard. This is what happened. No sighting but a vocalization. We had gone down to the campsite had built a fire and been down there for about an hour. During this time we all felt uneasy even though we had been there before many times. This is a long time ago but to the best of my memory we had been joking; probably made something to eat over the fire but something felt really wrong this time. ""Wrong"" is the best word I can use to describe. I remember I felt like I couldn't just sit down by the fire and stay with the conversation though. From back in the pine grove was the occasional, deliberate braking of branches that were just a little too large (to the sophisticated human ear) and just had the sound of being ""up off the ground some ways"" This would start and stop. We would listen and comment on it. First we thought maybe the mares had gotten back into the woods, unusual but this later was confirmed not to be so because we found out the next day that they were stabled for the night. We then thought it might be some older boys who were trying to scare us into running. It would be quiet for awhile then there would be a sense of movement closer to where we were and then receeding. We shined a flashlight and ventured back alittle ways but saw or smelled nothing. The sounds began again this time definately agitated, insistent with a very permiable feeling. We started to get un-nerved  moved out into the neighbors backyard. The sound grew louder, with traceable movement and then this ear splitting scream cut right out into the night. One loud shriek louder than anything should have to be. It just cut right to the core of your soul. Like so many reports I've read on this website, it's virtually impossible to do it justice with a human description precisly because it sounded so inhuman. We just ran like hell back to the house, left everything behind. No sense of being followed at all. No visual sighting (I almost wish). No bad smells or odors. In terms of other reports this pales, I know. But this is what happened and I never forgot it. We knew what Sasquatch were at the time, but no one ever heard of sightings east of the Mississippi to the best of my memory then. We kind of joked that maybe that's what our unseen friend was. Years later when I read and saw the reports from the southern part of York County (report on file with your website.) did I ever give any serious thought.",
It was May 1984. Two friends and I were up in the hills nw of Yamhill, OR, late in the evening, around 10:30 pm. We heard the scream, a VERY low, very long howl. Not a coyote, bear or cougar. Have heard all of them before. This was nothing like anything I have ever heard. I still remember thinking to myself ""How in the hell can something make such a low howl."" It scared us at first, but is sounded like it was far away, like maybe a mile or so. We were drinking a little beer, so after awhile we relaxed and forgot about it. It must have been about a half hour later when we heard it again. I swear that it had to be within 30 yards of us. Same loud, low howl, but MUCH closer. And it sounded pissed. I could feel the sound vibrations bouncing off the back of my neck. The hair stood up on the back of all of our necks. All of us turned white as hell, and our jaws dropped past our knees. The howl seemed to say ""GET OUT!"" Which is EXACTLY what we did. I just looked at the two other guys and said ""lets get the @#$ outta here "". We did not see anything, but felt the presence. I grew up within 10 miles of that spot. I had never heard that sound before, or since, EXCEPT on a television show that had a report of a bigfoot sighting. A guy in Idaho caught one on video (at least it looked like one), but when I saw the video, I heard that scream again. The guy taking the video threw the camera in the ditch, and hid. It was the SAME scream. ONLY other time that I have EVER heard it. It was EXACTLY the same scream. I saw this video on a news show, something like ""Real TV"" while in Fairfax, VA, in 1992 or 1993. I do not know EXACTLY what it is that we heard, but I know what I think it was. Bigfoot. That is my story, and I have two wittnesses to back me up.,
"My two children and I were returning from Altus,  Oklahoma to Burns Flat, Oklahoma in the fall of 1973 when a very large black man-like creature crossed the highway moving from west to east. I was driving and my son (age 11) was sitting in the front seat beside me and my daughter (age 12) was sitting in the back seat leaning forward between the driver and passenger seat. It was a clear sunny day about 3 PM and there was a lull in the conversation. It was quiet in the car, we did not have the radio on and all three of us were happened to be looking straight ahead. I noticed a movement on the left side of the road and was amazed to see a what I percieved to be a very large black man-like creature rise from a squatting position and run across the two lane highway about 30 yards ahead. It ran across the highway, covering the distance in only three steps, I estimate the creature to have been at least 8 feet tall, it glanced briefly in the direction of the car and I instictively applied the brake so as not to hit it. It ran into the bar ditch on the east side of the road and ducked into some brush and large bushes between the ditch and the barbed wire fence. It had hair that looked rather silky as it ran, I remember seeing the hair move as it ran. The hair did not appear to be stiff like an animals hair but more soft and shiny. Both children saw it too and said ""What was that, mama?"" I said I didn't know, they wanted me to stop the car, but I was frightened that my children and I could be harmed by something I had never seen before in my life. I didn't tell anyone what I had seen and cautioned the children not to say anything either.",
